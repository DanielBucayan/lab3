Black, a shade so mysterious.
It can be something depressing or something gorgeous.
Depressing as the heart break from someone you really love,
Or as gorgeous as the starry night sky above. 

Black can be quite scary.
It can resemble the feeling of being so empty.
The feeling of being all alone,
And being stuck in a place that is dark and unknown. 

Black also resembles the cold night.
Welcomes us after a long fight during daylight.
Greets us with the cold breeze of the wind
Helps us rest, so that tomorrow we will be, once again, determined. 

Black. Just like my life before I met you.
Everything's pitch black, can't see any beautiful view.
It is a good thing that I met you while searching randomly.
Now, because of you, an angel, everything is bright and so heavenly.

      <pre class="poem-content" id="moonlightPoemContent" style="display: none">
In the darkest of nights, there will always be lights.
It may be the city lights, or stars shining so bright.
But there's one thing that I have missed for quite some time.
It's the moonlight that once shone light on me. Hence, I am here to rhyme. 

I remember the past where I always wait for the moonlight's beam.
Patiently watching it as through my soul it shines and gleams.
I remember the moon singing me songs and lullabies.
Completing my every nights amidst all the temporary goodbyes. 

Right now, I haven't gone outside for quite a while.
I haven't seen the moonlight, even though it's just away for a couple miles.
The nights have been incomplete since then, with fewer reasons to smile.
But I am looking forwards to gaze upon the moonlight, for it will be worthwhile. 

I might not be outside watching you shine, but know that I always think about you.
I might not hear your whispers and lullabies, but know that it still plays in my mind, 
too.
I might not bear witness to your glory as of now, but know that i'm always cheering.
I might not be present, but I haven't forgotten the gift that is you, which is worth 
remembering.

    <pre class="poem-content" id="silentThoughtsPoemContent" style="display: none">
Staring at the crowd of people around. 
Observing what makes them happy and sound.
Trying to mimic the joy etched in their face,
But I can't seem to understand. My smile seemed out of place. 

Hiding these scars is one of the many reasons,
Of why I don't go out and cherish the seasons.
I am frozen by the cold memories, I can't seem to move on.
I can't even muster the strength to face the light of dawn. 

I try to fit in, but my broken pieces don't match the crowd.
I try to talk, but my voice speaks words with unspoken loud.
I wish to join in, but i'm too scared to be focused on and seen.
I wish I knew how, but I guess I don't fit those kinds of scenes. 

The world may never see what's happening under the shell. 
Just like how one can never see what's at the end of a well.
It might be deep. It might be shallow. It might be hard for me to swallow.
I guess i'll keep holding on for now. Don't worry, i'll be just fine with my shadow.

From the roots, it slowly grew.
Leaves were green, just like how we drew.
But we stopped at that, the magic went missing.
The colors turned brown. Everything started fading. 

These dry leaves will soon slowly fall.
Along with the memories of us all.
It will experience its one last glide as it slowly approach the ground. 
It will only be a matter of time when it's not, anymore, around. 

If that happens, you might be watering nothing,
You'll just waste the tears that would start falling,
When it needed sunshine, you made everything pitch-black.
When it needed attention, you just turned your back. 

The tree would be left with only branches alone.
Showing the supposed future that you could've maybe known.
Regret would kick in, but it can only do nothing.
It will suddenly make you wish that you could've done something.

Holding on to a piece of memory.
Like a broken glass, it deeply cut me.
Even though I'm bleeding and it hurts so bad.
Letting go is not one of the options I had. 

Slowly bleeding out, everything went pale.
The wonders and the experiences, all had gone stale.
The wind blew nothing in return, just coldness of winter.
The fallen leaves of autumn were reduced to nothing but cinders. 

The luminescent fireflies started to disappear.
And the deafening silence is the only thing I can hear.
My senses are slowly fading. I am lost in the beginning.
I slapped myself too many times only to find out I'm not dreaming. 

Drifting aimlessly in the darkness, with no horizon to gaze.
And everything felt like an impossible, unending maze.
Who could've thought that things could end up this worse.
Just by holding on tightly on the broken memories that brought happiness at first.

After a tiring day, I rested in my bed.
Suddenly, I somehow felt scared.
Memories just suddenly flooded through my head. 
The good ones, but also the ones that are almost dead. 

It felt like a ghost beginning to haunt me, 
Something eerie, and it's keeping me from being free.
Can't even afford to be a bit more happy, 
It's filling me with guilt, and starting to make me feel empty. 

It felt like leaves during fall season,
Or like tearing the pages of our story for no good reason.
All I can do now is just recall,
The, once, good memories and our downfall. 

It felt like it was suddenly winter,
The wind's so cold, it's making me shiver.
I am longing for our memories' warm embrace,
It might be fading, but I know no one can replace. 

Even if it hurts, those waning memories,
I hope it would stay in our minds' galleries.
I know it's impossible to go back and relive everything,
I mean, that's life, only change is everlasting.

I tried to reminisce, those waning memories,
Hoping it could be one of my sadness' remedies.
But it only added so much pain,
Because it made me realize that it's now just going down the drain. 

Even if you forget, those waning memories,
I still wish you the best, fine discoveries.
I know it will be replaced with new ones,
And we'll be strangers once again, exhibiting avoidance

It can be tiring to keep dancing all alone.
It can be exhausting when no one's answering their phones.
It can be draining to not be able to see what's up ahead,
When everything's keping you from going to bed. 

The story can get quite messy, and things can get out of hand.
Not everything is all sugar and sweet. Life can also be bland.
But you can be your own writer. You can be your own cook.
You're the one to decide whether to take the pawn or take the rook. 

The clouds will sometimes block the sun. The fog will sometimes block your view.
But that doesn't mean there is no sun or a beautiful scenery waiting for you.
There are times you need to wait, and times when you're being awaited.
So, don't be afraid to continue, for maybe life's waiting, for you, to be acquainted. 

It can be hard to realize your capabilities when you're afraid of the mirror.
That's why you must be in charge, and figure out who's that figure.
Only then it would be clear why you're still going, amidst all the wrongs.
Your story's a masterpiece in-the-making, and you're the one holding the pen all along.

Here I go again, trying my best to write and rhyme.
Counting one to ten, because you've already wasted my time.
I remember we were writing an original novel of ours,
Only for you to leave halfway. Left me alone to finish it with scars. 

Our game of hide and seek became serious. You were gone and I didn't know 
where you went.
I tried to seek for the reasons why the exclamation mark somehow got bent. 
The strong emotions we once felt in the present became our past,
And it became questions that we never wanted each other to ask. 

The attachment we once adored became a separation that you suddenly wanted.
The continuous stories of ours; you put a semi-colon just for your wish to be 
granted.
The breaks that you needed were given to you, and I had waited for you, my sun, 
to rise.
But the comma turned to period, and the wait ended in goodbyes. 

Our story was just starting, yet we ended so quick. 
It felt like getting hit in the head by a brick.
It was something I didn't expect. The last thing I wanted - you were just love's 
cruel trick.
We were the characters of our own story. We're supposed to live happily ever 
after in the resolution.
But I guess you never found it in me: The star to make your world shine, and 
you forced our novel to a sudden conclusion.

Laying in the grass, preparing for some late night epiphanies.
Shrouded by the sunday's mist, thinking about some possible remedies.
Remedies that I need to lessen the pain in my soul,
Because you threw me away in this tormenting hole. 

A hole that would never end, and would only repeat,
Making me suffer by remembering all the heartbeats.
It's all the meteor's fault for making me think we'd last.
When clearly, we're now nothing but each other's past. 

The colors you had painted in my world, you also erased.
The warm embrace turned into a cold shoulder in such a haste.
The bright smiles carved are changed into dreary faces.
The memories written down were slowly torn pages by pages. 

Still, I will treasure those sweet nostalgic lullabies,
For it made the moonlight's tears fall, just like my eyes.
But I'll do my best to forget and replace your image with a face of a silhouette.
It won't be easy, I know. It's like forgetting how gorgeous always is the sunset.

Two sad souls played by destiny's cruel game.
Made it seemed like everything's set to look great on frame.
Helped both of them create memories that would always remind each other's names.
Only to wash out every chances, and put out those burning flames. 

The wind blew them apart, along with the clouds full of memories.
Fearing that everything would be erased and replaced by harsh realities,
He decided to write every magic that he thought was only possible in fantasies.
But it rained on his diary as he writes down the last part, recollecting the torn
pages within his libraries. 

As he stare and read what he wrote once more,
He decided to just let destiny win, as the last page he tore.
The page was brought by the wind to the other side of the shore.
That's where a woman caught it and was able to read it, dropping with her knees
on the floor. 

"From the stars to the sunset at the horizon, where the sky meets the sea.
You've somehow resembled everything that I wished to gaze and see,
But you've always been far away from me. Maybe that's how it's meant to be.
And that I can only long for you and wait 'til an apple grows in an orange tree."
