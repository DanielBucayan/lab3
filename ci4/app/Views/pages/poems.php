Black, a shade so mysterious.
It can be something depressing or something gorgeous.
Depressing as the heart break from someone you really love,
Or as gorgeous as the starry night sky above. 

Black can be quite scary.
It can resemble the feeling of being so empty.
The feeling of being all alone,
And being stuck in a place that is dark and unknown. 

Black also resembles the cold night.
Welcomes us after a long fight during daylight.
Greets us with the cold breeze of the wind
Helps us rest, so that tomorrow we will be, once again, determined. 

Black. Just like my life before I met you.
Everything's pitch black, can't see any beautiful view.
It is a good thing that I met you while searching randomly.
Now, because of you, an angel, everything is bright and so heavenly.

    <pre class="poem-content" id="silentThoughtsPoemContent">
Staring at the crowd of people around. 
Observing what makes them happy and sound.
Trying to mimic the joy etched in their face,
But I can't seem to understand. My smile seemed out of place. 

Hiding these scars is one of the many reasons,
Of why I don't go out and cherish the seasons.
I am frozen by the cold memories, I can't seem to move on.
I can't even muster the strength to face the light of dawn. 

I try to fit in, but my broken pieces don't match the crowd.
I try to talk, but my voice speaks words with unspoken loud.
I wish to join in, but i'm too scared to be focused on and seen.
I wish I knew how, but I guess I don't fit those kinds of scenes. 

The world may never see what's happening under the shell. 
Just like how one can never see what's at the end of a well.
It might be deep. It might be shallow. It might be hard for me to swallow.
I guess i'll keep holding on for now. Don't worry, i'll be just fine with my shadow.

Holding on to a piece of memory.
Like a broken glass, it deeply cut me.
Even though I'm bleeding and it hurts so bad.
Letting go is not one of the options I had. 

Slowly bleeding out, everything went pale.
The wonders and the experiences, all had gone stale.
The wind blew nothing in return, just coldness of winter.
The fallen leaves of autumn were reduced to nothing but cinders. 

The luminescent fireflies started to disappear.
And the deafening silence is the only thing I can hear.
My senses are slowly fading. I am lost in the beginning.
I slapped myself too many times only to find out I'm not dreaming. 

Drifting aimlessly in the darkness, with no horizon to gaze.
And everything felt like an impossible, unending maze.
Who could've thought that things could end up this worse.
Just by holding on tightly on the broken memories that brought happiness at first.

It can be tiring to keep dancing all alone.
It can be exhausting when no one's answering their phones.
It can be draining to not be able to see what's up ahead,
When everything's keping you from going to bed. 

The story can get quite messy, and things can get out of hand.
Not everything is all sugar and sweet. Life can also be bland.
But you can be your own writer. You can be your own cook.
You're the one to decide whether to take the pawn or take the rook. 

The clouds will sometimes block the sun. The fog will sometimes block your view.
But that doesn't mean there is no sun or a beautiful scenery waiting for you.
There are times you need to wait, and times when you're being awaited.
So, don't be afraid to continue, for maybe life's waiting, for you, to be acquainted. 

It can be hard to realize your capabilities when you're afraid of the mirror.
That's why you must be in charge, and figure out who's that figure.
Only then it would be clear why you're still going, amidst all the wrongs.
Your story's a masterpiece in-the-making, and you're the one holding the pen all along.

      <pre class="poem-content" id="theMeteorsFaultPoemContent">
Laying in the grass, preparing for some late night epiphanies.
Shrouded by the sunday's mist, thinking about some possible remedies.
Remedies that I need to lessen the pain in my soul,
Because you threw me away in this tormenting hole. 

A hole that would never end, and would only repeat,
Making me suffer by remembering all the heartbeats.
It's all the meteor's fault for making me think we'd last.
When clearly, we're now nothing but each other's past. 

The colors you had painted in my world, you also erased.
The warm embrace turned into a cold shoulder in such a haste.
The bright smiles carved are changed into dreary faces.
The memories written down were slowly torn pages by pages. 

Still, I will treasure those sweet nostalgic lullabies,
For it made the moonlight's tears fall, just like my eyes.
But I'll do my best to forget and replace your image with a face of a silhouette.
It won't be easy, I know. It's like forgetting how gorgeous always is the sunset.

Two sad souls played by destiny's cruel game.
Made it seemed like everything's set to look great on frame.
Helped both of them create memories that would always remind each other's names.
Only to wash out every chances, and put out those burning flames. 

The wind blew them apart, along with the clouds full of memories.
Fearing that everything would be erased and replaced by harsh realities,
He decided to write every magic that he thought was only possible in fantasies.
But it rained on his diary as he writes down the last part, recollecting the torn
pages within his libraries. 

As he stare and read what he wrote once more,
He decided to just let destiny win, as the last page he tore.
The page was brought by the wind to the other side of the shore.
That's where a woman caught it and was able to read it, dropping with her knees
on the floor. 

"From the stars to the sunset at the horizon, where the sky meets the sea.
You've somehow resembled everything that I wished to gaze and see,
But you've always been far away from me. Maybe that's how it's meant to be.
And that I can only long for you and wait 'til an apple grows in an orange tree."
